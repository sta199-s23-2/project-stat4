    "text": "We are interested in the topic of food accessibility (defined as the ability to access healthy and affordable foods) in the US and how factors such as family income, vehicle availability, and neighborhood characteristics such as average income and availability of public transportation impact food accessibility. Our data is from the United States Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service, which contains information about US county’s ability to access supermarkets. Though there is no available information on how the USDA ERS collected this particular data set, the USDA ERS generally collects data in the following ways: surveys, administrative data, census data, and remote sensing. Given the variables of the food access data, it is likely that the USDA ERS used a combination of surveys and census data to collect information. This data set contains information about people’s ability to access supermarkets in the US. There are multiple factors that are taken into account. Each of these factors negatively or positively affects people’s ability to access a supermarket. Some people live further away or closer to supermarkets, have cars, have higher income, and are of different age demographics. Each of these factors contribute to differences in food accessibility.\nBackground on the Topic of Food Insecurity: (https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health/literature-summaries/food-insecurity). This article talks about food insecurity, which is a condition in which someone has limited access to adequate food. A lot of households are affected by this. It can be long-term or temporary and is influenced a variety of factors, such as by income, employment, race/ethnicity, and disability. High unemployment rates in low-income populations make it even more difficult to have sufficient food access. In 2020, Black households’ food insecurity percentage was 21.7, which was 2 times greater than the national average. Possible reasons include neighborhood conditions, physical access to food, and lack of transportation. People who live in low-income neighborhoods may have less access to supermarkets. Predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods have fewer high-quality markets than predominantly white neighborhoods. Food insecurity could lead to negative health problems and there are studies which demonstrate how food insecurity may increase risk for obesity and developmental/ mental health problems in children.\nResearch Question: Is the Midwest more impacted by being low income and being beyond 10 miles from a supermarket compared to the Northeast? If there is a difference between those two regions, and what variables contribute to that?\nDefinitions of Key Variables: County: County Name Population: Population Count from 2010 Census State: State Name Housing Data. Total Housing Units: Occupied Housing Unit Count from 2010 Census Vehicle Access. 10 Miles: Housing Units without Vehicle Count Beyond 10 Miles from Supermarket Low Access Numbers.Low Income People. 10 Miles: Low income population count beyond 10 miles from supermarket Low Access Numbers.People.10 Miles: Population count beyond 10 miles from supermarket Low.Access Numbers.Seniors.10 Miles: Seniors population count beyond 10 miles from supermarket. There are a mix of quantitative and qualitative variables.\nResearch Question:\nIs the Midwest more impacted by being low income and being beyond 10 miles from a supermarket compared to the Northeast? If there is a difference between those two regions, and if so, what variables contribute to that? Our target population for this question are individuals living in the Northeast and Midwest area of the US, as the Northeast is generally more urban and the Midwest is generally more rural and agricultural-based. We hope to bring awareness to potentially significant differences in food access because everyone should have access across the US, regardless of geographic location. This question is original because it is focusing on a “10 mile” range specifically. This research question will be answered using a hypothesis test and confidence intervals. Given our background research on the Midwest and the Northeast regions, we hypothesize that the Midwest will be mostly impacted by having a greater proportion of low income population count beyond 10 miles from supermarkets. We will conduct a hypothesis test to test this hypothesis. We are also exploring an additional question to support our hypothesis test: What is the confidence interval for the true mean proportion of low income individuals that live beyond 10 miles from a supermarket in the Northeast? In the Midwest?\nData cleaning: We first mutated the data set to categorize each state into their respective region (Midwest, Northeast, Southwest, Southeast, and West). We also mutated the data to include the proportion of low income population count beyond 10 miles from supermarket, the proportion of housing units without vehicle count beyond 10 miles from supermarket.\n\n\nRows: 3,142\nColumns: 25\n$ County                                          <chr> \"Autauga County\", \"Bal…\n$ Population                                      <dbl> 54571, 182265, 27457, …\n$ State                                           <chr> \"Alabama\", \"Alabama\", …\n$ `Housing Data.Residing in Group Quarters`       <dbl> 455, 2307, 3193, 2224,…\n$ `Housing Data.Total Housing Units`              <dbl> 20221, 73180, 9820, 79…\n$ `Vehicle Access.1 Mile`                         <dbl> 834, 1653, 545, 312, 7…\n$ `Vehicle Access.1/2 Mile`                       <dbl> 1045, 2178, 742, 441, …\n$ `Vehicle Access.10 Miles`                       <dbl> 222, 32, 201, 0, 0, 80…\n$ `Vehicle Access.20 Miles`                       <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ `Low Access Numbers.Children.1 Mile`            <dbl> 9973, 30633, 3701, 419…\n$ `Low Access Numbers.Children.1/2 Mile`          <dbl> 13281, 38278, 4943, 48…\n$ `Low Access Numbers.Children.10 Miles`          <dbl> 1199, 516, 791, 90, 0,…\n$ `Low Access Numbers.Children.20 Miles`          <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ `Low Access Numbers.Low Income People.1 Mile`   <dbl> 12067, 38848, 9290, 64…\n$ `Low Access Numbers.Low Income People.1/2 Mile` <dbl> 15518, 48117, 11901, 8…\n$ `Low Access Numbers.Low Income People.10 Miles` <dbl> 2307, 846, 2440, 102, …\n$ `Low Access Numbers.Low Income People.20 Miles` <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ `Low Access Numbers.People.1 Mile`              <dbl> 37424, 132442, 19007, …\n$ `Low Access Numbers.People.1/2 Mile`            <dbl> 49497, 165616, 23762, …\n$ `Low Access Numbers.People.10 Miles`            <dbl> 5119, 2308, 4643, 365,…\n$ `Low Access Numbers.People.20 Miles`            <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ `Low Access Numbers.Seniors.1 Mile`             <dbl> 4393, 21828, 2537, 226…\n$ `Low Access Numbers.Seniors.1/2 Mile`           <dbl> 5935, 27241, 3348, 263…\n$ `Low Access Numbers.Seniors.10 Miles`           <dbl> 707, 390, 629, 72, 0, …\n$ `Low Access Numbers.Seniors.20 Miles`           <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe wanted to see if having no vehicle access and being beyond 10 miles from a supermarket is associated with being low income and being 10 miles from a market. Therefore, we created a scatter plot. There is a positive relationship between the proportion of having no vehicle and being beyond 10 miles away from a market and the proportion of low income who are 10 miles away from a supermarket for both regions. As the proportion of no vehicle access who are 10 miles away increases, so does the proportion for individuals who are low income and are 10 miles away from a market.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe wanted to see if being a senior who lives beyond 10 miles from a supermarket is associated with being low income and being 10 miles from a market. Therefore, we created a scatter plot. There is a positive relationship between the proportion of being a senior and living 10 miles away from a market and the proportion of low income who are 10 miles away from a supermarket for both regions. As the proportion of being a senior and living 10 miles away increases, so does the proportion for individuals who are low income and are 10 miles away from a market.\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation for Density Curve: Based on if there was no vehicle access beyond 10 miles from a supermarket, the density curves for both regions have a similar shape, with the Midwest having a slightly higher density of lower values of vehicle access compared to the Northeast. There is some overlap between the two regions in terms of the distribution of vehicle access, indicating that there are some areas in the Midwest with similar vehicle access to supermarkets as some areas in the Northeast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  .metric .estimator .estimate\n  <chr>   <chr>          <dbl>\n1 roc_auc binary         0.718\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  .metric .estimator .estimate\n  <chr>   <chr>          <dbl>\n1 roc_auc binary         0.718\n\n\nBased on both ROC Curves, the AUC for both is around ~0.717, indicating a strong predictor value for the given region."

    "text": "Literature Review\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30792950/ This study examines the relationship between access to a personal vehicle and diet, food insecurity, and physical activity among public housing residents, which are typically low-income, urban populations. The study conducted a cross-sectional survey of randomly selected households within two public housing communities in Baltimore, MD. The study used Poisson regression with robust error variance to estimate relative risk ratios adjusted for demographics and perceived environmental factors.\nThe independent variable was whether or not the resident had access to a personal vehicle which the dependent variables were ‘high’ fruit & vegetable intake (>= 6.7 servings/day), ‘high’ added sugar intake (>+ 39.9 tsp/day), food insecurity, and being physically active. The sample included 265 adults with mean age of 45 years, 86% women, and 96% African-American. Only 42% had access to a vehicle.\nThe study found that there were no significant associations that existed between personal vehicle access with diet or physical activity outcomes. However, the study found that access to a personal vehicle was associated with significantly lower risk of food insecurity (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63-0.92, p < 0.01). There was a significant association between personal vehicle access and lower risk of food insecurity.\nIn connection to the article, our research explores other factors beyond transportation (specifically vehicle access) such as family income and the availability of public transportation. Our research also expands across both urban and rural areas in the United States while the article focuses exclusively on Baltimore, MD. Moreover, our research attempts to understand the relationship between various geographical regions, accounting for numerous variables."

    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\nFirst, in order to clean our data and prep for the data analysis and models, different region vectors were created in order to merge with the original food_access datasets. Since our research question involves regions and the original datasets does not include that, multiple mutate with case_when was used to clean and modify the data.\nIn order to explore the basic relationships, first some exploratory data analysis was conducted to see which specific states in the regions our research question was exploring. By quantifying and visualizing the relationship between the variables in the Midwest and Northeast, the sample mean difference is extracted from the given regions. This is used to run a hypothesis test in order to answer our research question. [CONFUSING EDIT With a null distribution and p-value either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the two regions.] This would help answer our research question as it would show which region is impacted more by taking the mean of the proportions of low income people 10 miles away from the supermarket without a vehicle. Based on the results of the hypothesis test, we run a confidence interval in order to see where the true mean lies in each region.\nIn order to find which variables contribute to the Midwest region being more impacted by low income and no transportation, a linear regression model is used as the low income people without vehicle access beyond 10 miles from a supermarket is the explanatory, and the number of people living in housing quarters as the response variable. This would be the best variable to use in the linear regression because the other data refers to children, seniors, and other varying amounts of vehicle distance. Therefore, housing group quarters population would be the best variable to use in this linear regression model and would help solidify the second part of the research question.\nWe choose a hypothesis test because it helps answer our research question if the Northwest or Northeast is more impacted by being low income and living 10 miles away from a supermarket. We hypothesize that compared to the Northeast, the Midwest will be mostly impacted by having a greater proportion of low income population count beyond 10 miles from supermarket. Our null hypothesis is that the true mean proportional difference for low income and beyond 10 miles from the supermarket between the Midwest and Northeast is equal to 0. Our alternate hypothesis is that the true mean proportional difference for low income and beyond 10 miles from the supermarket between the Midwest and northeast is greater than 0. Using the resulting p-values from our test, we can see if the Midwest is more impacted or if there is no difference between the two. We will be using simulation based techniques. We will permute all observations together, distribute them into two new groups, calculate the new sample means for each group, and lastly subtract the new sample means. This will be done 5000 times.\n\\(H_o\\): \\(\\mu_{Midwest} - \\mu_{Northeast} = 0\\)\nNull Hypothesis: The true mean proportional difference for low income and beyond 10 miles from the supermarket between the Midwest and northeast is equal to 0.\n\\(H_a\\): \\(\\mu_{Midwest} - \\mu_{Northeast} > 0\\)\nAlternative Hypothesis: The true mean proportional difference for low income and beyond 10 miles from the supermarket between the Midwest and northeast is greater than 0.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n   mean\n  <dbl>\n1 0.112\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n    mean\n   <dbl>\n1 0.0167\n\n\n[1] 0.09569124\n\n\nThe sample mean proportion of low income population count beyond 10 miles from the supermarket is .11 for the Midwest region and .017 for the Northeast region.\n\\(\\bar{x_{Midwest}} = .11\\)\n\\(\\bar {x_{Northeast}} = .017\\)\n\\(\\bar{x_{Midwest}} - \\bar{x_{Northeast}} = 0.09569124\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  p_value\n    <dbl>\n1       0\n\n\nConclusion: The probability of observing a true mean proportional difference of 0.09569124 between the Midwest and the Northeast for low income population count beyond 10 miles from the supermarket is equal to 0, given that the true mean proportional difference for low income and beyond 10 miles from the supermarket between the Midwest and Northeast is equal to 0 the difference is equal to 0. Because p = ~ 0 alpha = .05, we reject the null hypothesis. We have strong evidence to conclude the alternate hypothesis. Based on this test, we can answer our research question and conclude that the Midwest is more impacted than the Northeast for low income and being beyond 10 miles from a supermarket.\nConfidence Interval: True mean proportion for Midwest\nAfter our result from the hypothesis test, we wanted to further support that the Midwest is more impacted than the Northeast. Therefore, we will be creating two confidence intervals to determine the true mean proportion for low income and living 10 miles beyond a supermarkets. We will then compare these intervals. The interval with a higher proportion interval will be the most impacted by being low income and living 10 miles beyond a supermarket. We will be used simulation based techniques because we are sampling with replacement, calculating the new resampled mean, and then we will be repeat that process 5000 times.\n\n\nRows: 5,000\nColumns: 2\n$ replicate <int> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 1…\n$ stat      <dbl> 0.1144171, 0.1136144, 0.1131544, 0.1066412, 0.1130759, 0.120…\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  lower upper\n  <dbl> <dbl>\n1 0.103 0.123\n\n\nWe are creating a histogram to see the distribution of re-samples from our original data for Midwest.

We used a linear regression to see which variables affect that. We choose the variables proportion of seniors and no vehicle access being 10 miles away. First, we fit those variables individually. Then we looked at their adjusted r-squared values. The linear regression with the proportion of seniors had a higher adjusted r-squared value. So then we included an additive and interactive component with the proportion of having no vehicle access. The interactive model had a higher adjusted r-squared value."

    "text": "Results\nBased on the exploratory data analysis, The first graph is a density plot that shows the distribution of vehicle access beyond 10 miles for both the Midwest and Northeast regions. The x-axis represents the distance of vehicle access beyond 10 miles, while the y-axis represents the density of the distribution. The graph is relevant as it shows the difference in the distribution of vehicle access between the two regions. For instance, the Midwest region appears to have a higher density of vehicle access beyond 10 miles than the Northeast region. The third and fourth ROC graph curves represent where the x-axis represents the false positive rate, while the y-axis represents the true positive rate. The graph is relevant as it shows the ability of the logistic regression model to distinguish between the Midwest and Northeast regions based on vehicle access beyond 10 miles. For instance, the higher the AUC, the better the model is at discriminating between the two regions. They both have an AUC of around 0.717, indicating a high prediction rate based on the regions and no vehicle access. This helps quantify the strength of the relationships and set up for the hypothesis test.\nConclusion of Hypothesis Test: The probability of observing a difference of 0.09569124 between the mean proportion of the Midwest versus the Northeast and low income population count beyond 10 miles from the supermarket is equal to 0, given that the difference is equal to 0, is p = ~0. Because p = 0 $alpha$ = .05, we reject the null hypothesis that the true mean proportional difference between the Midwest and low income population count beyond 10 miles from the supermarket is equal to 0. We have strong evidence to conclude the alternative, which supports our hypothesis that the Midwest has more low income populations 10 miles away from supermarkets than the Northeast.\nInterpretation: We are 95% confident that the true mean proportion of low income individuals that live beyond 10 miles from a supermarket in the Midwest is between 0.102609 and 0.1226445. (Other confidence)\nThese two graphs support our claim that the Midwest is more impacted as the proportions for the Midwest reach higher numbers for the proportion of low income who are 10 miles away. Moreover, it shows that having no vehicle access contributes to this problem, supporting our claim that the Midwest is more impacted by not having reliable access to transportation compared to more urban areas like the Northeast.\nWe wanted to see if having no vehicle access and being beyond 10 miles from a market contributes to low income and being 10 miles from a market. Therefore, we created a scatter plot. There is a positive relationship between the proportion of having no vehicle and being beyond 10 miles away from a market and the proportion of low income people who are 10 miles away from a supermarket for both regions. As the proportion of no vehicle access who are 10 miles away increases so does the proportion for individuals who are low income and are 10 miles away from a market.\nWe wanted to see if being a senior who was beyond 10 miles from a market contributes to low income and being 10 miles from a market. Therefore, we created a scatter plot. There is a positive relationship between the proportion of seniors living 10 miles away from a market and the proportion of low income people who are 10 miles away from a supermarket for both regions. As the proportion of being a senior and living 10 miles away increases so does the proportion for individuals who are low income and are 10 miles away from a market.\nLinear regression: We created a linear regression to see which variables affect low income and being 10 miles away for the Midwest. We found that the best model was when the proportion of seniors and proportion of no vehicle access being 10 miles away interacted with each other. This model had the highest adjusted r squared value (0.8715612). A higher r-squared value indicates a higher amount of variability being explained by our model. Therefore, our adjusted r-squared value supports that our interactive model is a good fit for our data. This value answers the second part of our research question. Individiuals who are a senior and have no vehicle access and being 10 miles beyond a supermarket contribute to low income and being 10 miles beyond a supermarket in the Midwest."

    "text": "Discussion\nWe have learned from our research question that the Midwest has a smaller true mean proportion of low-income households that have vehicle access to a supermarket 10 miles away compared to the Northwest, with a p-value of ~0 when assuming that there is no difference.\nThe analysis included the state with the most no vehicle access which was District of Columbia. However, the District of Columbia only has one row of collected data and therefore, we could not perform an accurate linear regression in order to quantify the relationship between the variables contributing to the no vehicle access and low income. This could be a limitation of the analysis and therefore combining more data from other datasets would help further strengthen this analysis. Not much could be analyzed from housing quarters and no vehicle access, and more could be gleamed from combining other data sets. There could be more influential variables affecting the low access, low income people living 10 miles away, however only much could be done using this data set.\nAlso, since this dataset was collected by census and surveys, there could be a sample size and representation bias. Surveys often rely on a sample of people to represent a larger population. If the sample size is too small or not representative of the population of interest, the results may not be generalizable to the broader population.\nSome potential areas of future interest include: relationship between food access and health outcomes, or socioeconomic factors. With the data on health outcomes available in the dataset, researchers could explore whether living in an area with limited food access is associated with poorer health outcomes, such as higher rates of obesity, diabetes, or heart disease. The dataset could expand to include information on income, education level, and race/ethnicity. Researchers could explore whether these factors are associated with differences in food access, and if so, which policy interventions might be effective in addressing these disparities."

However, one per data set is required.)\n\nAre there greater gender differences in the consumption of zero vegetable or fruit for low income countries than in upper-middle income countries?\n\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\n\nWe are researching global data on infant and young child feeding, and specifically on vegetable and fruit consumption. The UNICEF global database on infant and young child feeding details the percentage of children 6-23 months of age who did not consume any vegetables or fruits during the previous day. Previous studies have shown that children from low- and low-middle countries had the lowest consumption of fruits and vegetables. Globally, zero vegetable or fruit consumption is very high with 46% of children consuming no vegetables or fruit the day before the survey. We hypothesize that there are male infants are better fed than female infants in lower-income countries whereas this gender gap is less prevalent in upper-middle income countries.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\nThe variables involved in our research question are quantitiative, with the indicator being the percentage of children 6-23 months of age who did not consume any vegetables or fruits during the previous day."

Child undernutrition has the greatest impact in low- and middle-income countries, with the greatest impact on Asian and African children. The study explores the three groups of conditions as a result of undernutrition, which includes stunting, wasting, and underweight. The study found that child feeding practices are influenced by multidimensional determinants, including personal, household and community factors. It was often that higher maternal education is associated with appropriate child feeding practices and the findings were in line with previous studies that demonstrate children of mothers with high educational level displayed better complementary feeding indicators.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nOur research question builds on the topic of child complementary feeding, but will focus on the aspect of gender to compare feeding practices for male and females. Additionally, our research question will examine these differences across countries, with a focus on income (comparing low-income countries to upper-middle countries)."

The observations for each specific county is the count of people living in quarters and how far each one lives from a supermarket without a vehicle. There is also population of kids on the same distance markers used to determine the distance from a supermarket. This further divides into low income and senior divisions."

However, one per data set is required.)\nFactors in the data that affect access to supermarkets are age, distance, income, transportation, and area. Which of these mostly affects access to supermarkets?\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\nLooking at the United States Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service, we see a data set that contains information about people’s ability to access supermarkets in the US. There are multiple factors that are taken into a account. Each of these factors negatively or positively affects people’s ability to access a supermarket. Some people live further away or closer to the markets, have cars, have higher income, live in different areas, and have different ages. Each of these factors contributed to different numbers for supermarket accessibility. We will be exploring each category to see which factor mostly affects the lower numbers to access of supermarkets by comparing each factor’s data.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\nQuantitative- miles away, age group, income, low access numbers, population\nCategorical - state, county"

Alot of households are affected by this. It can be a long or temporary thing and is influenced by income, employment, race/ethnicity, and disability. High unemployment rates in low-income populations make it even more difficult to have sufficient food access. Moreover, disabled adults have a higher risk for food insecurity because they have less employment opportunities and health-care related expenses. This gives them less money to buy food. In 2020, Black households’ food insecurity percentage was 21.7, which was 2 times greater than the national average. Possible reasons include neighborhood conditions, physical access to food, and lack of transportation. Some people who live in urban and rural areas, low-income neigborhoods may have less access to supermarkets. Predominantly black and hispanic neighbors have fewer good quality markets than predominantly white and non-hispanic neighborhoods. Having food insecurity is very bad because it could lead to negative health problems. There are studies that support that food insecurity increases risk for obesity and developmental and mental health problems for children.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nOur research question builds on the article. It seeks to find the greatest affect on someone’s ability to access supermarkets. Although the article is more specific. It includes race, disabilites, and employment as possible factors while our data doesn’t include that."
